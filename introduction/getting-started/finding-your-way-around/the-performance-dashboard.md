# The Performance Dashboard

The Performance Dashboard is the typical landing spot when you first log in to the application. It only appears if you have a set of Performance Measures and Goals defined for your role. The tab displays these as indicators, gauges or graphs and you can click on these to see the details of the performance measure. For the performance gauges, clicking on these will display a time chart. For the time charts, clicking on a data point will open the relevant documents for that point. For example, clicking a bar in the Open Invoices Amount graph will open the Invoice \(Customer\) window with the set of open invoices loaded.

The Performance Tab can also display lists of important documents that you may need to deal with.

Setup properly for your role, the Performance Tab should provide you with accurate information about the things that are important for your job and provide guidance on the tasks you need to perform.
