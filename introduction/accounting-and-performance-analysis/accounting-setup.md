# Accounting Setup

The process for setting up the accounting system in ADempiere is partially done when the Client is created.  A set of default accounts is required in the Client creation process and these ensure the system will work as soon as the Client is first used.  The setup process modifies these initial defaults so the accounting is tailored to your enterprise.

There are six main steps in the setup:

1. Define the Calendars and periods in each;
2. Create the Account Elements \(also called the Chart of Accounts\) required;
3. Define the Accounting Schema or books that will be used by the Client;
4. Define the General Ledger categories that will be used in the accounting facts posted to the books;
5. Define the document sequences that will be used to number the various documents; and 
6. Define the document types specific to the Client.

Each step is covered in the following chapters.
